# InfluxSPA
Single Page Webapp GUI interface to InfluxDB

At the moment it only works with Influx 1.x stream. 

Allows easy looking at what databases, users and schemas are configured. Has a very basic browser for looking at stored data and can sort of run queries via a text input box, although the output may not render fully. 


Beerware license.


To use it download the files and drag index.html into your browser, will grab a few Javascript libraries online so will need some tweaking for a disconnected machine.
