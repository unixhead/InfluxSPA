# InfluxSPA
Single Page Webapp GUI interface to InfluxDB

At the moment it only works with Influx 1.x stream. 

Was mainly created to have a play with Influx and Javascript. It's pretty basic at the moment, will probably get around to expanding it at some point but life gets in the way!


Beerware license.


To use it download the files and drag index.html into your browser, will grab a few Javascript libraries online so will need some tweaking for a disconnected machine.
